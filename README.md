# Talk2Task
Talk2Task simplifies tasks by dividing them into smaller subtasks and carrying out each step using a chosen tool.
Leveraging one-shot prompting, it uses minimal input to generate structured responses, which are then converted into actionable commands. Essentially, it translates user-friendly conversation into command-line execution, making task management and system interactions intuitive and efficient.
